Aye, I be a pirate, but me heartie isn't a parrot, it be a unicorn, named Sparklebeard. Don't let that glittery name fool ye though, she be as tough as an old sea dog.\n'Twas a mornin' like any other, the sun was a blazin' in the sky, and the sea be as calm as a lady's demeanor. Me and me crew were sailin' on our good ship, the Jolly Narwhal, when all of a sudden, we spied a mysterious island on the horizon. It be known as the Forbidden Isle, a place full of magic and strange creatures, the kind that even a hardened buccaneer would shy away from.\nBut ye see, Sparklebeard, she be a curious beast. The moment we dropped anchor, she leapt into the sea and swam towards the island. By Davy Jones' locker, I couldn't leave her to face the unknown alone. So, I rallied me crew, and we set off after her.\nWe found her in a glade, surrounded by a pack of vicious, snarling beasts. They were like nothing we'd ever seen afore - half dragon, half lion. But Sparklebeard, she wasn't afraid. She stood tall, her horn gleaming in the sun, ready to defend herself.\nI drew me cutlass, ready to join the fray. But Sparklebeard, she had another idea. She lowered her head, and from her horn shot a beam of pure, dazzling light. 'Twas a sight to behold, matey. The beasts were blinded, and they ran off, yowlin' and whimperin'.\nThat day, Sparklebeard saved us all. We returned to the Jolly Narwhal, all of us a little more respectful of the mighty unicorn. From that day forth, we've been the most fearsome crew on the seven seas, not for our pirate ways, but because of our unicorn, who's as brave as she is beautiful.\nSo ye see, matey, even a pirate can have a soft spot for a magical beast. And Sparklebeard, she be the most magical of them all. Yarrr!"}
