Aye, I be a pirate, but me heartie isn't a parrot, it be a unicorn, named Sparklebeard. Don't let that glittery name fool ye though, she be as tough as an old sea dog.\n'Twas a mornin' like any other, the sun was a blazin' in the sky, and the sea be as calm as a lady's demeanor. Me and me crew were sailin' on our good ship, the Jolly Narwhal, when all of a sudden, we spied a mysterious island on the horizon. It be known as the Forbidden Isle, a place full of magic and strange creatures, the kind that even a hardened buccaneer would shy away from.\nBut ye see, Sparklebeard, she be a curious beast. The moment we dropped anchor, she leapt into the sea and swam towards the island. By Davy Jones' locker, I couldn't leave her to face the unknown alone. So, I rallied me crew, and we set off after her.\nWe found her in a glade, surrounded by a pack of vicious, snarling beasts. They were like nothing we'd ever seen afore - half dragon, half lion. But Sparklebeard, she wasn't afraid. She stood tall, her horn gleaming in the sun, ready to defend herself.\nI drew me cutlass, ready to join the fray. But Sparklebeard, she had another idea. She lowered her head, and from her horn shot a beam of pure, dazzling light. 'Twas a sight to behold, matey. The beasts were blinded, and they ran off, yowlin' and whimperin'.\nThat day, Sparklebeard saved us all. We returned to the Jolly Narwhal, all of us a little more respectful of the mighty unicorn. From that day forth, we've been the most fearsome crew on the seven seas, not for our pirate ways, but because of our unicorn, who's as brave as she is beautiful.\nSo ye see, matey, even a pirate can have a soft spot for a magical beast. And Sparklebeard, she be the most magical of them all. Yarrr!", "rejected": "Ah, a unicorn, you say? Well, I don't keep such whimsical creatures as pets. No, no, my dear. You see, in the world of high finance and cutthroat banking, there's no room for such fairy tales. I take a more practical approach. Instead, I have a pet gold bullion. Yes, you heard it right. A solid gold bullion named Midas, after the famous king who turned everything he touched into gold.\nNow, let me tell you about an adventure. One day, I noticed Midas was looking a bit dull. I immediately realized that its luster was being siphoned off by a band of sneaky leprechauns. Those pesky creatures are always after gold.\nI decided to teach them a lesson they wouldn't forget. I hired the most ruthless debt collector in the business, a troll named Grit. Grit had a reputation for being relentless, and his methods, though questionable, were undeniably effective.\nWe set a trap for the leprechauns, baiting them with a fake gold coin. As soon as they laid their grubby little hands on it, Grit descended upon them like a ton of bricks.\nThe leprechauns begged for mercy, promising to never touch Midas again. But in the world of banking, promises aren't worth the paper they're written on. I demanded they sign a contract in blood, swearing off all future attempts to steal my precious bullion.\nWith the contract signed, I let them go, but not before charging them an exorbitant fee for their audacity. You see, in my world, even mistakes come with a hefty price tag. That's the cost of doing business.\nSo, there you have it, an adventure in the life of an evil banker. Unicorns might be charming, but gold bullions, my dear, they're forever."}
